# Elderscape Server

  The ultimate RuneScape private server.
 
## Networking
  The base distribution provides a networking implementation using jBoss Netty. Netty is extremely fast, and automatically scales toward the host environment. Our implementation accomplishes tasks fast, but also in a clean manner.
