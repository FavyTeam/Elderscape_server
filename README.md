## Networking
  The base distribution provides a networking implementation using jBoss Netty. Netty is extremely fast, and automatically scales toward the host environment. Our implementation accomplishes tasks fast, but also in a clean manner.
  
## Systems
  All of our systems were made with 'expansion' in mind.
  With RuneCore, you can add new content without hussling over slow and untidy systems.
